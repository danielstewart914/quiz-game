## Description

### This is a fun knowledge quiz to see how much you know about JavaScript.
As part of my Full Stack Developer course I was tasked with creating a simple quiz using javaScript that interacts with the DOM to display questions along with a timer to limit the time you have to take the quiz. <br>

I try to give my projects some extra polish above and beyond the bare minimum, so for this project I added the following:
- Animations and color to the 'correct' or 'wrong' responses when you answer a question. 
- An animated '-5' for when you answer a question incorrectly.
- An animation on the end screen when adding the time remaining to your score.
- Formatting to code snippets within questions so that they match the formatting in VSCode.
